The first solution involves using an echo statement to display the value of the q parameter on the page as is, without any processing. This approach is susceptible to XSS attacks since it doesn't validate or sanitize the input, and any harmful script included in the q parameter can be executed by the browser.

The second solution utilizes the header() function to redirect the user to a new URL that contains the q parameter's value after the /browse/ section of the URL. The script execution is stopped after the header is sent using the exit() function. This solution is not vulnerable to XSS attacks since the htmlspecialchars() function can sanitize the input and prevent script execution. Nevertheless, it's important to note that this approach is still prone to open redirect attacks since it redirects the user to the URL specified by the q parameter without validating the input. To prevent such attacks, the input should be validated against a list of approved values, and only a secure location should be used to redirect the user.
